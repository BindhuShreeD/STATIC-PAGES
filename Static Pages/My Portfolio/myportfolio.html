                <h3><b>Building a Smart E-Commerce Supply Chain : IoT  and ML-Driven Optimization for Cross-Border Trade</b></h3>
                <h4></h4><b>Short description about the project.</b> </h4>
                <p> The proposed framework integrates IoT for real-time tracking and ML for predictive optimization. This system addresses the challenges of cross-border e-commerce by improving transparency, reducing delays, and optimizing resource allocation.
                    
                    By combining cutting-edge technologies, the framework can enhance the efficiency and reliability of the global supply chain.
                    </p>
                <p><strong>Technologies:</strong> IOT, Machine Learning Algorithms, optimization techniques</p>

                <h3><b>Insurance management System</b></h3>
                <h4></h4><b>Short description about the project.</b> </h4>
                <p> An online insurance management system is a software application that allows insurance companies 
                    and policyholders to manage their insurance policies and related information through the internet. 
                    It aims to improve efficiency and automation of insurance processes, enhance customer 
                    experience, increase accessibility and convenience, and better data management and reporting. 
                    However, it also has its limitations such as dependence on technology, data security concerns, and 
                    costs. The implementation of such a system requires a proper requirement collection and analysis, 
                    choosing the right software and hardware, and a well thought out plan for maintenance and 
                    updates. </p>

                <h3>Client Server Architecture</h3>
                <h4></h4><b>Short description about the project.</b> </h4>
                <p>The users of this client server simulation will be able to view content as it takes place in the client – server network. The fully functional system as per the functional requirements is ready for 
                    deployment. It will be used share study materials at the institutional level and later will be made 
                    open for public to use. Testing of the application is done to ensure its integrity and reliability.   
                    The simulation serves to provide a simulation where the users can see the data packets as they 
                    move between the client and server within a given network. This can be used for educational 
                    purposes where the students can learn about what exactly happens in TCP communication. </p>
